## Flask Travel Scheduling Application Design

### HTML Files

- **home.html**: 
   - The landing page for the application. 
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for selecting departure and destination, date of travel and mode of transport. 
   - Contains a form that allows users to enter their travel preferences and submit them to the application.

### Routes

- **`/`**: 
   - Maps to the home page, 'home.html'. 
   - When accessed, it displays the user interface for specifying travel preferences.

- **`/schedule`**: 
   - Receives the user's travel preferences via a POST request from the home page. 
   - Processes the preferences and performs necessary calculations to generate a list of suitable travel options. 
   - Renders a new HTML page, 'schedule.html', which displays the generated schedule.

- **`/schedule.html`**: 
   - Displays the list of travel options generated by the '/schedule' route. 
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for viewing and selecting the preferred option.

### Additional Notes

- The front-end will be built using Bootstrap for a consistent and responsive design.
- The application can be further enhanced to include additional features such as user authentication, account management, and payment integration.
- The application should be hosted on a reliable platform to ensure accessibility and performance.
